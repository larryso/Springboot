# Springdoc-OpenAPI for Spring Boot REST Documentation

## Introduction to OpenAPI 3.0 and SpringDoc
The springdoc-openapi helps to automate the generation of API documentation of spring boot projects in [OpenAPI 3.0](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/latest.html) format. It examines the application at runtime to infer API semantics based on class annotations and configuration beans.

By default, SpringDoc automatically generates documentation in JSON/YAML formats. When Swagger UI is enabled, it uses Swagger API to generate the documentation in HTML format, too.

SpringDoc supports most of the Spring modules out of the box. It is able to examine the code in runtime for all these modules and generate appropriate documentation for them.
